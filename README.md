Transformer based hybrid model for predicting CRISPR/Cas9 single guide RNA cleavage efficiency


## OS Dependencies
We use [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the backend for training and testing.

[ViennaRNA](http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/) should be downloaded and installed in advance in order to capture the important biological features of sgRNA.
